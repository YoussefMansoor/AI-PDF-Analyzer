# AI-PDF-Analyzer
This project is a local AI-powered PDF analysis tool that allows users to upload a PDF file and interactively ask questions about its contents. Using Ollama, a local machine AI model, the system processes the document, extracts key information, and enables users to query the file in a conversational manner.
